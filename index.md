Week 1 Reflection: 

  This week’s readings constituted a series of investigation about the pre-history of the nowadays Internet. Carey’s Technology and
  Ideology: The Case of the Telegraph and Wu’s The Master Switch formed a analytical introduction about the telegraph as the predecessor 
  of internet, and Wu brought some general ideas about research and development of novel technologies. Gillespie, along with Dourish’s 
  work, provided a rather technical analysis about the general architectures of Internet structure. 
  

  Carey’s article took a socio-technological approach to analyzing the technological and ideological significances of telegraph as what
  the author called the “foundation of the electrical goods industry” (2, Carey). The article analyzed the role telegraph played in the
  developing industrial America. The telegraph not only was the landmark of science and engineering based management methodologies
  (notably for its role played in railway system) and industries, it was also a watershore in communication for the important changes such 
  medium of communicator bought to moral, linguistic and economic realms. For the first time a novel, universal language was developed, 
  and instead of physical carriers the electric signals became the mediator of communication. Moreover, the telegraph separated the 
  communication from physical transportation, and thus new business and managerial doctrines became possible. The humane elements, namely
  the personal interactions, were thus gradually replaced by telegraphic communication over spaces. And the instantaneous nature of 
  telegraphic communications paved the road for trade against times, namely the future contracts. The author investigated the telegraph 
  and how it replaced the traditional means of communications with envisioned and active form of scientific extension. And it also touched
  the fact that such a product not only fostered the creation of industrial empires like the West Union, but eventually it also straggled 
  in such monopolistic circumstances built by those giants. This discussion about technology and the monopolies was followed in Wu’s work,
  where the author mentioned the (rather spiral in my understanding) “cycle” of technological products: the search for business efficiency
  boosted and constrained such development at the same time, and hence gave the birth to rather new technologies as the old ones reached
  their bottlenecks.
  

  The second part of this week’s readings investigated the internet’s technological histories along with some debates over it through the
  engineering and designer’s aspects of such developments. In particular, Gillespie’s work was a discourse about the term “end-to-end” and 
  how this notion affected the cultural negotiations about the internet, ranging from the discourse about the basic architectures and 
  social construction of internet development to copyright disputes. The author collectively referred works from Saltzer, Reed, and Clark
  to describe the notion of  “end-to-end” as a principle to unite “scattered set of design strategies”. And Gillespie moved forward to
  investigate the usage of such notion outside of the engineer’s circle and how such “symbolic shape of internet” interacted with resent
  discourses about digital copyrights. The “end-to-end” appeared from early discourses about internet structure and was used to describe 
  either the adjunction of networks, the particular route of a specific packed data, or the network’s capacity to handles terminal 
  functions in the entire system. In a specific example the author illustrated how this terminology embedded itself into the dispute about
  digital copyrights. The user wanted the free information but the industries advocated the restrictions. The debate was rather
  intensified with the introduction of p2p file-trading system. Thus the term “end-to-end” transformed from a mere technical term to a
  certain iconographic and even philosophical principle, and in the case of file-trading and copyrights, such terms was referred to where
  the “power” of network should be located. Furthermore, Dourish’s work served as the complement of Gillespie’s discussion by introducing
  the concept of “other-nets” as the alternative envisions of internet design and principles, along with some technical introductions
  about the general design and topologies of such alternatives.
