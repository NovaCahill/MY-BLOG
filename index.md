Week 1 Reflection: 

  This week’s readings constituted a series of investigation about the pre-history of the nowadays Internet. Carey’s Technology and
  Ideology: The Case of the Telegraph and Wu’s The Master Switch formed a analytical introduction about the telegraph as the predecessor 
  of internet, and Wu brought some general ideas about research and development of novel technologies. Gillespie, along with Dourish’s 
  work, provided a rather technical analysis about the general architectures of Internet structure. 
  

  Carey’s article took a socio-technological approach to analyzing the technological and ideological significances of telegraph as what
  the author called the “foundation of the electrical goods industry” (2, Carey). The article analyzed the role telegraph played in the
  developing industrial America. The telegraph not only was the landmark of science and engineering based management methodologies
  (notably for its role played in railway system) and industries, it was also a watershore in communication for the important changes such 
  medium of communicator bought to moral, linguistic and economic realms. For the first time a novel, universal language was developed, 
  and instead of physical carriers the electric signals became the mediator of communication. Moreover, the telegraph separated the 
  communication from physical transportation, and thus new business and managerial doctrines became possible. The humane elements, namely
  the personal interactions, were thus gradually replaced by telegraphic communication over spaces. And the instantaneous nature of 
  telegraphic communications paved the road for trade against times, namely the future contracts. The author investigated the telegraph 
  and how it replaced the traditional means of communications with envisioned and active form of scientific extension. And it also touched
  the fact that such a product not only fostered the creation of industrial empires like the West Union, but eventually it also straggled 
  in such monopolistic circumstances built by those giants. This discussion about technology and the monopolies was followed in Wu’s work,
  where the author mentioned the (rather spiral in my understanding) “cycle” of technological products: the search for business efficiency
  boosted and constrained such development at the same time, and hence gave the birth to rather new technologies as the old ones reached
  their bottlenecks.
  

  The second part of this week’s readings investigated the internet’s technological histories along with some debates over it through the
  engineering and designer’s aspects of such developments. In particular, Gillespie’s work was a discourse about the term “end-to-end” and 
  how this notion affected the cultural negotiations about the internet, ranging from the discourse about the basic architectures and 
  social construction of internet development to copyright disputes. The author collectively referred works from Saltzer, Reed, and Clark
  to describe the notion of  “end-to-end” as a principle to unite “scattered set of design strategies”. And Gillespie moved forward to
  investigate the usage of such notion outside of the engineer’s circle and how such “symbolic shape of internet” interacted with resent
  discourses about digital copyrights. The “end-to-end” appeared from early discourses about internet structure and was used to describe 
  either the adjunction of networks, the particular route of a specific packed data, or the network’s capacity to handles terminal 
  functions in the entire system. In a specific example the author illustrated how this terminology embedded itself into the dispute about
  digital copyrights. The user wanted the free information but the industries advocated the restrictions. The debate was rather
  intensified with the introduction of p2p file-trading system. Thus the term “end-to-end” transformed from a mere technical term to a
  certain iconographic and even philosophical principle, and in the case of file-trading and copyrights, such terms was referred to where
  the “power” of network should be located. Furthermore, Dourish’s work served as the complement of Gillespie’s discussion by introducing
  the concept of “other-nets” as the alternative envisions of internet design and principles, along with some technical introductions
  about the general design and topologies of such alternatives.

Week 2 

This week’s reading investigated the design concept, principle and architecture of modern webpage, and particularly explored the origin
and development of the hypertext concept within the framework of webpage construction. Specifically, Bush’s article As We May Think in the
year 1945 envisioned an extended method to better coordinate scientists’ needs for transmitting and extracting existing researches. The
readers could further trace that such idea was later endowed and formatted, in the language of hypertext and hyperlinks, by Berners-Lee at
CERN in his proposal regarding imposing a novel methodology in the field of information managements. 


For any type of information, Bush’s article proposed that it could be beneficial to scientific usages only if it could be continuously
extended, stored, and visited. And a designed cross-reference system based on this concept of continuously editable and viable information
formats was thus urged. Bush envisioned a mechanized private file archive, the “memex”, based on microfilm and index computing algorithms.
Such mechanism could not only help the user to extract parallel materials from existing records, but also allow the insertion of new 
material into the general body of the common record. The author blueprinted the platform of the interface as layered section of films, and
the user could use keyboard to type in pre-designed code in order to search for specific records. Bush described the operation sequence of
this memex in such the way that the user typed in the code and the title page of the archived materials, and by frequently using the code
the reader could be directed in to detailed notes, photo, memoranda, and navigate in between the archived records. The author envisioned a
codebook that contained the frequently referred codes, and the user can retrospectively refer to such book for guidance.


Such an idea of “memex” as a systemically organized, mechanized private file archive that interacts with the users so that the record it
contained could not only be frequently consulted, conveniently visited, but also be continuously extended was later formatted into the
concept of hypertext. The proposal by Berners-Lee at CERN about introducing the idea of connected information systems for better record
management for a large project such as LHC projects realized the concept described by Bush with the help of hypertext. Hypertext can be
concisely formatted with the following idea: a direct connection between two specific positions in a text. Information logistics and
management at CERN was proposed as a test field for hyperlinked structuring. Such structure allowed a collection of records to develop and
evolve with the organizations and the projects, and thus formed a dynamic system for the storage, extraction and distribution of
information. One can draw connections between the envisioned “memex” and the mature system of hyperlinked information web. Both mechanism
allowed the user to interact with a pre-designed interface, and conveniently accessing and editing the existing data. The collections of
material were parallel ordered, and the entire system was rather non-centralized. Such system equipped not only the scientific workers but
also the general public with a privatized, personalized and linked archives for a better control and understanding of daily-gathered
information.

Week 3 Reflections about Self-Portrait

The original idea of building my hypertext collage as a self-portrait was inspired by the works of Picasso, particularly by his
revolutionary cubist work Still Life with Chair Caning. This work was celebrated for being modern art’s first collage, and it introduced
the practice of embodiment, implementation and reinterpretation of commercial preexisting objects into the traditional realm of painting.
For example a hard-textured rope was used to serve as the edge of this work. Personally I find his idea of collaging somewhat resembled 
the idea of documenting with hyper-links and hypertexts, as it can be seen that Picasso “attached” some “hyper-linkable” premade artifacts
to his collage and thus created a novel sense of connection between his work and the reality. 


In terms of page design, I separated the entire page into three blocks, each containing three layers: introductory front page, sub-layer,
and the gallery. The blocks are represented by three primary colors. This idea comes from a famous abstract work by Mondrian, namely the
Composition with Red Blue and Yellow in 1930. His work abstracted the practice of painting to its purest level with merely the primary
colors along with the horizontal and vertical lines, resembling the fundamental elements of painting. For my web design, the introductory
pages and their sub-layers incorporated some minimalist approaches as I decided to reduce the format of the page into its most fundamental
and functional elements, specifically the comments and clickable hyperlinks. I used some template scripts provided by w3schools for the
galleries, attempted to resemble the practice of using premade artifacts as Picasso and Duchamp, and thus intended to represent a rather
increasing maturity and complexity of the page formats.


This project helped me better understand the implementation and structures of hypertexts we used in our daily lives. And it made the
points from the article What Hypertext is by Noah Wardrip-Fruin more vivid. The article itself provided a rather brief, historical
introduction about the form and implication of hypertext concepts. And as one of the short definition by Theodor Holm Nelson (the funder
of hypertext concept) the author quoted, the hypermedia constituted by hyper links were based on a rather simple and concise concept that
such links constructed an interconnected complex that “it could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper”(Noah 2). Some other
characteristics of hypertexts, discoursed by Tim in the article Information Management: A Proposal, are also tested in this project. In 
terms of the webpage I designed, it is indeed decentralized and rather the collage constitutes parallel blocks. By using hyperlinks the
reader can navigate back and forth internally in between the blocks and galleries, swiftly access existing data uploaded to the file. The
readers can also use external links that direct them to sources from other websites, and in turn the hypertext included these outside
sources into my own document.


I find the process of building this webpage rather enjoyable (besides dealing with unfamiliar github UI), educational and enlightening. In
addition, I hided some secret links on the front page with some stenographical tricks for some personal amusements.

Week 4 

This week’s reading discussed the relationship and interaction between the designers and the users, and particularly interested in the 
inclusion of human factors into technical frameworks. The paper by Norman about DesignX reinvestigated the design approaches confronting 
challenges of complex sociotechnical systems, and addressed that the adversity of scaled design raise from implantation. The paper
advocated the designers continue to play an active role in such stage, and proposed the application of incrementalism throughout the 
problem-solving process. The book by Hayles took a rather huge leap into the sociotechnical analysis about the virtual bodies in 
cybernetics through literatures and informatics, and it served as an abstract proposal about the inclusion of human factors into not only 
specific field of research like design, but also into the global consideration about the technologies and how it integrated, physically or
metaphysically, with individuals and society. 


Norman’s paper provided an case study about a major collaborative project in UCSD Health Science departments and university hospital 
system to examine and attempt to enhance the care of cancer patients receiving radiation oncology, as an example to illustrate the 
adversities the designers of the project may encounter. The designers must coordinate the interaction between specialists from multiple
field of research, along with reviewing the treatment records and set multiple practice plans accordingly at different levels of details.
The complexity came from the entangled departments, specialists, disciplinary and consequently the priorities setup and facilities
managements. Such forms of large-scale public and cross-disciplinary projects posed challenges to the designers throughout the designing 
process from the basic principles to implement follow-ups. The paper proposed the human-factor-centered design, and suggested rethinking
the problems that had been considered as mere human err. The author suggested that the proper solution is to reconsider the problems as
results from interacting human behaviors, and such behaviors should be embedded into the system. By redesigning the system so that the
underlying causes of problems from behavioral and psychological factors could be eliminated. The corresponding sociological, technological
and cultural adjustments were encouraged during the design process.


The paper also suggested the practice of incrementalism as a proper way to approach complex design problems. The design should be modular,
and by decomposing problems into modules the challenges could be overcome through the chain of positive feedbacks formed when the modular
task was accomplished, and on the other hand control the adversities at a certain step might not harm the entire project much. In the
commentary by Flach, the author presented an alternative and empirical perspective for cognitive systems engineering. The author proposed 
an emphasis on the “shaping the users’ internal models to be consistent with the pragmatic realties”, rather than the traditional 
performance that more focused on matching such internal models. 


The book by Hayles was rather hard to comprehend in my opinion. The book revisited the embodiment of cybernetics through literature and 
informatics. The book proposed a question (and the concept) about the shift from “human” to “posthuman”, and attempted to demonstrate the
embodiments and perspectives in the context of technological discourses and literary illustrations. The author discoursed speculative
classics of Wolfe, Dick, and contemporary fictions such as Snow Crash, and Terminal Games to explore and contest the construction of
“posthuman” in these works.

Week 5

This week’s reading discussed imminent problems about digital labor market and repairing e-wastes. The Los Angeles Times report by Gray 
advocated the corporations and governments to formulate portable benefits plans in order to protect the rights of digital workforces and to stabilize such on-demand, crowdwork market. While Jackson’s article served as a sociotechnical analysis about the practice and
appreciation of the practice of repairing, which is rather abstract. The article by Jackson considered such practice and mindset as the
fulcrum between two different worldviews: one is the fractal and collapsing and the other is hopeful and promising. The practice of repair
thus became a subtle act of care to the incomplete sociotechnical systems, so that such system can be maintained, transformed, preserved
and extended.


The web-based platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk reformatted the traditional employee-employer relations at the level of digital
service market. Such platforms connected the “users” as the solution providers who played the role of the traditional “employee”, and
“customers” as the service requestors that traditionally were “employers” altogether. But such connections were not formed through labor
contract but rather by terms of service, resembling software licenses. Such platforms thus outsourced fragmented tasks demanded by the
customers, ranging from individual needs to corporative missions, to scattered users. In addition, since the prices of the tasks are
counted unit wise, such outsourcing of crowdwork labors allowed the platform to dismantle the fixed wage into piecewise micropayments. The
report by Gray investigated a dispute between Riyaz Khan, a solution provider from India, and where he sold his labor to, the Amazon
Mechanical Turk. Amazon disabled his account after few years of work and consequently a portion of his payment was suspended by AMT. The
report found that the Terms of Service had granted Amazon with rights to suspend any payment account for any reason in their sole
discretion. Such absence of legal definition of rights and responsibilities of the platform users and providers threatened the rights of
crowdwork labors. 


A fact that personally interested me was that at the secondary market, the technical solutions platform like AMT did not change the
relationship of employment. It rather created another outsourcing market for the solution providers of such platforms so that these 
providers can sublet and sub-distribute their works to secondary technicians. The report revealed, on the other hand, that as the works
requested by AMT became more complex, the needs for collaborative works drove solution providers like Khan to be the secondary employer
and might distributed or transferred his account to his employees. And such transferring of account was, indeed, prohibited by the Terms
of Services signed between the users and AMT. Generally speaking AMT did have the right to suspend Khan’s account and payment for
violation of the terms. In this sense the Terms of Service partially served as the traditional contract between the employees of the
platform and the platform as the entity of employers. I personally think that such platform may originally intended to be a “paid-
volunteering” market for a paid exchange of knowledge and help from individuals. But as such market of solutions exchange expanded, it
shifted more towards to the labor market with structures of traditional employment relationships. And consequently I agreed with the
report by Gray that as such platform got more expanded, involved and sophisticated, regulations from corporations or governments should be
implemented so that the rights of digital labors could be granted just like its traditional counterparts.
